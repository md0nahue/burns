  "text": " Just over eight years ago, President Trump went to the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia and stood in front of a memorial wall dedicated to CIA officers killed in the line of duty. He used it as a backdrop for a speech that was largely about himself, his grievances and his perceived enemies. That speech was the day after his inauguration. At the time, it shocked a lot of people. It was a breach of decorum and grace. Well, today he did the same kind of thing and perhaps it was no big surprise. His backdrop this time was the Department of justice, which he's already filled with his attorneys and supporters. The setting was far more meaningful. It appeared to be a victory lap over the agency that indicted him in two federal cases that were dismissed after he won the election. His speech came after a number of DOJ attorneys and FBI agents involved in the prosecutions of the January 6th attackers that he pardoned were forced out. The president invoked a lot of his standard campaign lines about weaponization of justice against him and references to Hunter Biden's laptop. He even exited to the Village People's YMCA. The president made it clear all that pre-election talk about retribution, he meant every word. We will expel the rogue actors and corrupt forces from our government. We will expose and very much expose their egregious crimes and severe misconduct, of which was levels. You've never seen anything like it. It's going to be legendary. A purge has already begun the Justice Department. In January, more than a dozen attorneys who worked on January 6th prosecutions were expelled. Last month, at least eight senior prosecutors who worked on the cases were demoted. Earlier this month, James Denny, the top agent in the FBI's largest field office in New York, was forced out after he told colleagues in an email that officials there were, quote, being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy. I pardoned hundreds of political prisoners who had been grossly mistreated. We removed the senior FBI officials who misdirected resources to send SWAT teams after grandmothers and J6 hostages. Now, of course, the January 6th rioters were not hostages. They were not political prisoners, and it's shameful to compare them to actual political prisoners. Let's not forget Mr. Trump pardoned and commuted sentences for hundreds charged with or convicted of violent felony crimes. Assault in police officers, using a deadly weapon, participating in a riot, destroying government property. The longest sentence, 22 years, went to the former head of the so-called Proud Boys for seditious conspiracy and other charges. Even Vice President Vance and House Speaker Mike Johnson had said prior to the pardons that violent criminals should not receive them Well there were other false claims as well in the speech today The last administration presided over the worst increase in violent crime in our country in many, many decades. Again, not true according to actual FBI statistics. Let's see if they keep keeping statistics in the future. Violent crime in 2023 declined across the U.S. Murders down 12 percent. As for the first six months of last year, another big drop murders down 23%. This is what the president said about border apprehensions. In our first full month in office, we achieved the lowest level of illegal border crossings ever recorded. Well, as our Daniel Dale notes, this might be true had the president said the lowest level of illegal border crossings in many decades, but he didn't. What's more, the drop began during the Biden administration. Federal data released in September showed 54,000 encounters with migrants crossing the southern U.S. border. That's their lowest level since 2020. The president also attacked former President Biden. We also terminated the clearances of the Biden crime family and Joe Biden himself. He didn't deserve it. In fact, he was essentially found guilty, but they said he was incompetent and therefore let's not find him guilty, I guess. The former president was not found guilty essentially or otherwise. There was no judicial ruling. He wasn't charged with the crime. This is what the special counsel wrote in part, quote, the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, Robert Herr wrote that, quote, several defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges. Now, we should know that the president had praise for one member of the judicial system. We had an amazing judge in Florida, and her name is Eileen Cannon. And I didn't know her. I still don't know her. I don't believe I ever spoke to her, even during the trial. But I did appoint her federal judge. And these fake lawyers, these horrible human beings were hitting her so hard, public relations wise, they were playing the ref. I don't think it's legal. I don't think it's legal. Judge Eileen Cannon in Florida oversaw, critics said, slow walked the classified documents case. She eventually dismissed it. A conservative appeals court repeatedly reversed her rulings in a separate 2022 lawsuit brought by Mr. Trump involving the documents, scolding her for giving Mr. Trump special treatment no other private citizen would receive and shut down the review. Joining me now is CNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Ellie Honig Adam Kinzinger former Republican congressman who served on the House January 6th Select Committee and former U District Court Judge Schenlin Congressman Kinzinger, to see him at the Department of Justice in front of that crowd, what did you make of it? It's chilling. I mean, I think he was sending a very clear message, which is, this is my Department of Justice. He didn't come right out and say, hey, I'm going to direct you guys to go prosecute these people. but he would talk. I saw with like Cannon, he said, you know, there were people that went after, I don't know if it was illegal, but it was certainly, so he's sending a very chilling message. And the other interesting thing is what you see in there are, he's kind of giving a forgiving attitude to DOJ in essence saying, look, from here out, you guys are my people. Good to go. Let's talk about what old DOJ did. And in the process of that, you heard people applauding. You'd hear people applaud when he'd mention the name of the FBI director or whatever. And it was very creepy. And this is something that I think Americans, regardless of your political position, should really be worried about. Ellie, I mean, you know the Department of Justice. You worked at the Department of Justice for many years. Have you ever seen something like this? No, Anderson, what happened today, that speech was a desecration of the Justice Department, of the Great Hall of Justice, where it was given. And AGs and occasionally presidents of both parties have used that room for decades to address the rank and file, like I once was, to call on the highest principles of DOJ. The person who that building is named after is Robert F. Kennedy, Sr., to be clear. And just to give a sense of the type of speech that ordinarily gets given by an AG to prosecutors, I pulled this. I just want to read real quick how RFK ended a speech he gave in 1962 when he was AG. He said to the group, in closing, let me tell you how important I think your work is to the future of our country. History knows no inevitability except as men surrender to their own fears of the future. I salute you and I wish you well in your work. Now, today, by contrast, we have Donald Trump calling prosecutors Marxist, scum, savages and thugs. We have a five minute speech on Bobby Knight in Indiana basketball. We have talk about the price of eggs and bacon. We have stuff about Hunter Biden's laptop. We have a riff about Norm Eisen, why I have no idea. We have the fact that firefighters, probably not a fact, but the claim that firefighters voted for him by 94%. We have mentions of Al Capone, Wyatt Earp, Rudy Giuliani. And then it ends with, I actually thought I was hearing something wrong. YMCA, that song, they played it and he danced to it on the stage of the Great Hall. It was disgraceful. Judge what did you make of it I mean yeah YOU HAVE BAD FOR THE CONFIRMATION FROM MORE LAW REN hornSvoff D jong I THINK THAT WHAT I THINK JUDGE WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT I MEAN YEAH HOW DO YOU THINK ACTUALLY SITTING FEDERAL JUDGES WHO OBVIOUSLY THEY WORK FOR A SEPARATE BRANCH BUT WATCHING THAT, WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY FEEL? YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY. IT'S ALL PROJECTION. HE SEEMED TO TAKE THE OPPOSITE POSITION OF WHAT YOU WOULD THINK ON EVERYTHING. SO HE SAID IT WAS SO TERRIBLE OF THE MEDIA TO ATTACK JUSTICE CANNON, JUDGE CANNON. SHE'S SUCH A WONDERFUL JUDGE. And it's as if he didn't realize what's going on with attacking judges now, calling them traitors, calling them they should be impeached. And his henchmen, Musk, Mike Johnson, et cetera, they are going forward with thinking about impeaching federal judges for making decisions they think are right. So on the one hand, he was so critical of attacking Cannon. And on the other hand, didn't see that it's the flip side. And so that just really stunned me that he didn't see that parallel. And he did that in a couple of other contexts, too. He talked about the weaponization of the Justice Department. I can't imagine anything more weaponized than the way he handled that speech as what he called himself the chief law enforcement officer of the country, as if he's now going to direct the Justice Department, the FBI, what they should do, who they should prosecute. And he went after his enemies list. I mean, there used to be this sort of agonizing of presidents about, you know, meeting with the head of the Department of Justice, about keeping independence, not, you know, the president not influencing stuff. He gave them, he gave. Having a FBI director that stays over for multiple administrations. It could be a Republican. It could be a Democrat. You keep, I mean, the idea that there was weaponization, but now there's not going to be. I mean, it's an Orwellian. Well, exactly. He gave them the hit list. He told them exactly who he really wants prosecuted, starting with Alvin Bragg, Tish James and Norman Eisen, Mark Pomerantz. I mean, he laid out a whole list, Biden, of course, and many others. And that was the list. He's basically sending a message, go after them. They were not fair to me. They need to be prosecuted. If I can pick up on that quickly. Look, I was critical of a lot of the Trump prosecutions. Anderson, you know well, I said many times I disagreed with the way some of these cases were charged and tried. THAT SAID, THINK ABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S LOGIC HERE IS. HE BASICALLY STOOD IN FRONT OF THAT CROWD AND SAID, I'VE EXPERIENCED FIRSTHAND. I KNOW HOW BRUTAL IT IS WHEN DOJ GETS USED AGAINST YOU. NOW, WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BACK TO EVERYONE ELSE. I MEAN, IT'S A CHILD-LIKE VIEW. IT'S RETRIBUTIVE. HE JUST WENT ON A BENDER, ESSENTIALLY. IT'S ILLOGICAL AND IT'S DANGEROUS.",
