  "text": " In this video, I want to talk about a highly successful YouTuber by the name of Cassidy Campbell. Cassidy is best known for his prank videos, where he approaches strangers in public, usually women, while playing one of his many outlandish characters. These characters range from goofy to downright bizarre. There's the wankster, a wannabe gangster in the style of Sasha Baron Cohen's early G. Booyah, cut shot. I used to be black, but I have repented of my sins and now I'm white. Would you say that underwear would stop a fart? Sometimes I smoke a little bit of crack, but it's just like two plus. I'm not addicted. Addiction is like when you need it, you feel. I just want it. Complete with an ankle monitor. There's Brett Duches, who's an obnoxious gym bro. Who gives? You're not playing now? Oh, when you're concussed, you're gonna care, bro. Oh, she loves me. Hey, what was that about you saying you would slap the shit out of me back there? Excuse me? I just wanna... Slap me! Come on, slap me! Gah! Always trying to one-up everyone, there's the spoiled rich kid who throws tantrums and flaunts his wealth like royalty among peasants. Oh my god. She's probably poor. Look at these 9 to 5s right here. Making 30k a year. F*** out of here with that shit, peasant. Anyways, what I was gonna say was, I am not taking note for answer, ladies. Well, what do you f***ing know about giving some... Brain. Ah, what is brain? Brain? The dome. Dome, a little head. This is not made by iPhone, but it's an iPhone charger. That's fine, that's all you need. I want this. Bradley! And we can't forget Michael, who's a flamboyant caricature of a gay man. Oh! Oh! Oh my god! Can I get the number? No. Sweetie, you couldn't handle this if you tried. Oh! Oh, daddy! You're looking like a healthy snack! If I just like acted like that, maybe you get turned on. Yeah, I was just acting gay so I could get with you. Yeah, is that okay? Why not? And that's just scratching the surface. As entertaining as these characters may seem, the focus of this video isn't on any of them. Instead I want to talk about Cassidy most fascinating and unintentionally comedic persona of all Himself That right The man behind the characters is perhaps even more anomalous than the personas he performs Watching his videos, you might wonder, how is he able to portray these absurd, often disturbing characters so very convincingly? Maybe he's just a naturally gifted actor or comedian. For a long time, I wasn't sure. But now, I feel confident saying that the reason why these characters come so effortlessly to Cassidy is that he isn't acting. Rather, his characters are fragments of his own psyche. That is, Cassidy isn't inventing characters. He's expressing repressed urges and beliefs through them. using comedy as a cover to test the social waters. These personas are less satire and more self-exposure. I understand that I've made a bold claim, but before I defend it, it's worth revisiting Cassidy's early days on YouTube to understand better the kind of person he is. his priorities, ambitions, character, and mindset. See, Cassidy didn't begin his YouTube journey with pranks. In fact, he started out as a fitness channel. Cassidy branded himself as a natural bodybuilder and documented his workouts, his diet, and his progress with what seemed like transparency and self-awareness. But even in this phase, the seeds of performative identity were being sewn. See, Cassidy wasn't just chasing muscle. He was chasing an image. His channel name, Train to Look Good Naked, says it all. It wasn't about health or strength. It was about vanity, seduction, performance, perceptions. His content often revolved around public validation. He'd go to women and ask them which physique they prefer. A muscular guy more attractive than a guy with just an average body. Out of all these different male body types, which would you prefer and why? C? Yeah. And why? Need collaborate with bigger names in the fitness sphere Grego Gallagher Rich Piano Mike O to boost his own image. It follows from Cassidy's superficial priorities that he'd be interested in anabolic androgenic steroids, since they represent the ultimate shortcut to Cassidy's goal of looking good naked. And interested in steroids Cassidy was. He'd mention them in post after post, though not in a confessional manner. Nevertheless, I do seem to recall that in a now-deleted video, Cassidy attributed his balding to steroid abuse. Of course, my memory isn't perfect, so I'd welcome anyone who remembers differently to clarify in the comments. Still, there are a few things that raise eyebrows. There was Cassidy's rapid and dramatic transformation in muscle size and strength, followed by a similarly rapid and dramatic loss of those gains after he moved away from fitness content. There's the fact that many of Cassidy's older videos, some of which I remember as potentially incriminating, have been deleted. And there's the fact that Cassidy's former friend, Eric Konevsky alleged that Cassidy abused steroids. on a little dose of test no i'm not scared of finasteride side effects plus i'm on trt so i'm not going to experience a lot of those side effects that somebody not on trt would experience but at one point for many years you were on test trend decca d ball i mean you were on enough that you could have looked like you could at least bench the bar so if you're going to talk about my steroid use like it's some big secret the next time make sure to bring up yours as well taken together these patterns suggest to me, not as a definitive claim, but as a personal interpretation, that Cassidy natural image may have been more of a performance than a bro I am nattie I am nattie You not nattie man You not nattie People saw you fucking nattie Fuck out of here. He was very skinny and he never made any gains. And then all of a sudden, for him, he blew up. For him. You know, he was benching 275 for reps. How many guys in your gym bench 275 for reps? Not very many. Is it possible for a natural to do that? Hell yeah, it's possible for a natural to do that. How many naturals do it after looking like Cassidy Campbell for years and then all of a sudden within three to six months they're doing that? Zero. If we were to run with my conjecture, then Cassidy being a fake natural wouldn't just be a case of someone being caught in a lie. It would be an early glimpse into what seems to be a recurring pattern with Cassidy. That is presenting exaggerated versions of himself that reflect not just who he is, but who he wants to be. The only difference is that this particular role, the natural bodybuilder, may have relied less on acting and more on injections. Cassidy had always dipped his toes into the prank genre. He'd mock fitness figures such as Brad Castleberry with ridiculous caricatures. But it was when he went all in on the prank content that he really started to blow up. I was curious to see how far he'd push the envelope, so I stayed subscribed. And boy, did he push it. He'd fire random employees while pretending to be the company's CEO. Yeah, I gotta fire you. Okay. Okay. You can keep the shirt. He'd blast pornography in public libraries. I'm getting the feeling of coming in the gym, I'm getting the feeling of coming at home, I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage. I mean he was finding increasingly creative and bizarre ways to humiliate himself. But if the goal was to grow his channel then it definitely worked. Cassidy was indefatigable. He'd pump out new videos, characters and skits at an impressive pace. I admired Cassidy's work ethic and audacity, but I could never quite figure out what his true motivations were. To get a better understanding of Cassidy's comedy, I want to compare him briefly to the great Sacha Baron Coe,",
