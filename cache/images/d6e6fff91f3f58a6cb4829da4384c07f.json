According to Darwin's son Erasmus, \"The picture is a replica of the one in the rooms in the Linnaean Society and was made by Collier after the original. I took some trouble about it and as a likeness it is an improvement on the original.\" Given to the National Portrait Gallery, London in 1896. See source website for additional information.",
