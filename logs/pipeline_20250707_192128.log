❌ VIDEO GENERATION FAILED
============================================================
Error: Step 5 failed - Video generation: Lambda video generation failed: Some segments failed to process

🔧 Troubleshooting tips:
  • Check your API keys are properly configured
  • Ensure AWS services are accessible
  • Verify the audio file is in a supported format
  • Check network connectivity
  • Try running with test_mode: true for debugging
